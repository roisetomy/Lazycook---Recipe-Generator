    "## 🎉 Complete Feedback-Driven System Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **What This System Now Does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📚 Learns from Past Feedback**: \n",
    "   - Analyzes all stored user feedback to identify patterns\n",
    "   - Knows what users love and what they hate\n",
    "   - Incorporates these lessons into new recipe generation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🧠 Enhanced Generator**:\n",
    "   - Uses feedback insights to create better recipes\n",
    "   - Avoids patterns that users disliked in the past\n",
    "   - Incorporates successful elements from highly-rated recipes\n",
    "   - Gets smarter with each piece of feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **🔍 Smart Reviewer**:\n",
    "   - Reviews recipes based on learned user preferences  \n",
    "   - Better predicts what users will actually like\n",
    "   - Uses past feedback patterns to make decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **🔄 Iterative Improvement**:\n",
    "   - Each feedback cycle makes the system better\n",
    "   - Stores new feedback for future learning\n",
    "   - Shows learning progress and improvement metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **⚔️ Comparison Mode**:\n",
    "   - Compare basic vs feedback-enhanced generation\n",
    "   - See the difference learning makes\n",
    "   - Demonstrate improvement over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Key Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **✅ Actually Uses Feedback**: Unlike before, feedback now actively improves recipes\n",
    "- **📈 Gets Better Over Time**: Each user interaction makes the system smarter\n",
    "- **🎨 Personalized Generation**: Learns your users' preferences and adapts\n",
    "- **🔍 Predictive Quality**: Can predict user satisfaction before they even cook\n",
    "- **📊 Measurable Improvement**: Track how learning improves recipe quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏃‍♂️ **How to Use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Time**: Run `iterative_feedback_workflow(question, ingredients)` to generate and collect feedback\n",
    "2. **See Learning**: Run it again with different recipes to see how it learns\n",
    "3. **Compare**: Use `compare_basic_vs_learning()` to see the difference\n",
    "4. **Monitor**: Watch the system get better with each feedback example\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is now a true learning system that improves recipe generation based on real user feedback! 🔥**"

Or maybe the assistant is allowed to use the given ones even if it's less than nine.\n",
