    Command-line entry point for generating and reviewing recipes with LazyCook.
    
    Steps:
    1. Prompts the user for a cooking question and available ingredients.
    2. Searches for similar recipes using Pinecone and embeddings.
    3. Generates a new recipe using an LLM, with review and improvement loop.
    4. Prints the final recipe and shopping list.
    5. Loads the CLIP model and generates an image for the recipe, displaying the best match.
    6. Intelligently manages shopping list with ingredients to buy.
